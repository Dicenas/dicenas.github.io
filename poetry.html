    <div class="title">Bad Little Birdies</div>

    <div class="poem">
        Five bad little birdies sat high on a wire,<br>
        Each full of mischief, each playing with fire.<br>
        Their leader, so daring, with tricks up his sleeve,<br>
        Urged on the others, who’d all soon cease to breathe.<br><br>

        The first spied a cat with a flick of its tail,<br>
        Decided to prank it - how this fail?<br>
        With a leap and a pounce, the cat took its prize,<br>
        Now four birdies remained, and none looked too wise.<br><br>

        The leader then sneered, “Go guard the bird bath,<br>
        Scare off the others! Go show them your wrath!”<br>
        It scared off the flock but returned to the wire,<br>
        Where it touched the wrong spot and went up in fire.<br><br>

        Three bad little birdies, their antics not through,<br>
        One chased a hummingbird, swift as it flew.<br>
        Across the wide road, it zipped with a squawk,<br>
        Till it met a fast truck - and now there were two.<br><br>

        The fourth spied a window, its reflection so clear,<br>
        Thinking that it saw a rival bird near.<br>
        It dove at full speed with a challenging cry,<br>
        But the glass didn’t budge, and the bird said goodbye.<br><br>

        The last, their bold leader, spied a feeder so fine,<br>
        It slipped through the bars, thinking, “These seeds are all mine!”<br>
        But predators circled, their claws scraping near,<br>
        The bad birdie's bravado dissolved into fear.<br><br>

        The feeder shook wildly, the seeds spilled below,<br>
        The leader watched helplessly, his hunger would grow.<br>
        Taunted by beasts who could not break through,<br>
        The leader stayed put, unsure what to do.<br>

        Trapped in the cage, with no way to eat,<br>
        It whimpered and cried, accepting defeat.<br>
        With nothing to eat, the leader grew thin,<br>
        Trapped with his shame in the cage it died in.<br><br>
