        <h1>Sitting with the Problem</h2>
        <h4>A Metaphysical Inquiry Into the Nature of Chairs</h4>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The humble chair sits in the corner of an empty room waiting to be sat on. 
            Its four legs planted firmly on the floor - one could argue it was standing.
            One could argue that, that in a way, it was alive - much like you and I.
            How quaint, the image. And yet, as humble as chairs may be, there is a hidden depth to their 
            nature that challenges our most stubborn and deep seated beliefs concerning ontological realism.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">It stands to reason that a chair is more than
            just a physical object; the very idea of a chair begs the philospher to ask himself:
            "What is a chair?". For indeed the chair is a philospher's most important tool,
            and its essence transcends its own existence. The very idea of a chair exists independently 
            of any actual chair, residing in the realm of abstraction. And yet, are ideas not, per se, 
            chairs in their own way? For just as a chair supports the body in contemplation, so too do 
            ideas serve as the structural frameworks upon which the mind may rest and explore. 
            Thus, each idea becomes, metaphorically, a seat for thought - a conceptual chair upon which 
            the philosopher reclines in pursuit of truth. Though the chair does not have a mind of its own, 
            it serves as an extension of the philosopher’s intellect; a silent partner in the act of 
            contemplation, a participant in the dialectic. 
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Consider a man on all fours, 
            his back flat, poised to support another’s weight. Is he, in that moment, still 
            a man, or has he descended - or perhaps transcended - into something else altogether? 
            Does he achieve his "chairness" the moment someone sits upon him, or does the mere 
            potential for support suffice to reclassify his existence? And if so, what does this 
            say about the fleeting nature of identity itself?
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Yet, upon closer inspection, the man on all fours lacks 
            the backrest that defines many chairs. By form alone, he aligns more closely with 
            the stool, a humbler cousin of the chair. This raises questions about the distinctions 
            between stools and chairs: Is it the presence of a backrest, the number of legs, 
            or merely our perception that sets them apart? A stool typically has three or four 
            legs - stable yet minimal. But what of a one-legged stool? Would such an object, 
            balanced precariously, even count as furniture?
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Let us now consider a one-legged man with no arms. Does he, in his 
            singularity, approximate a stool more than a chair? And if so, does his inherent 
            instability render him an unworthy candidate for "stoolhood," or does it elevate 
            him as a symbol of impermanence and balance? But let us now dig deeper, invoking the 
            Ship of Theseus. If we modify this one-legged man - perhaps replacing his back with a 
            flat wooden plank or his limbs with sturdy metal poles - at what point does he cease 
            to be himself? Is he still the man he once was, merely altered, or does each replacement 
            part pull him further from his essence, transforming him into something else entirely? 
            If every component of his being is eventually replaced, yet he still functions 
            as a chair, where does the man end, and where does the chair begin? Engage upon it.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Perhaps, in the end, it is not the number of legs 
            that matters but the capacity to hold up the weight of expectation - whether 
            literal or metaphorical. Thus, the stool, the chair, and the man become 
            united in a shared existential purpose: to endure, however briefly, 
            the burden placed upon them.
