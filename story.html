        <h1>Against the Grain</h2>
        <h4>A coming of age story about wheat</h4>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Once upon a time, along the edge of a shimmering golden field, under a wide, open blue sky, there stood a talking stalk of
            wheat named Will. Will was an oddball. Except he wasn’t a ball at all, he was a stalk of wheat. From the day
            he first germinated within the soil, Will knew something was different about him. But it wasn’t talking that
            made him odd. Nor was it the fact that he was a sentient stalk of wheat with a name. Like who even named him
            Will? His parents?</p>
            
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Will didn’t have parents. This, however, did not bother him. In fact, this made him
            rather normal amongst the other wheat stalks. No one remembered how they got into the soil - it seemed
            almost as if they all just sprouted out of an empty field.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">And yet, the fact remained that Will was indeed different. While the other stalks swayed gracefully in the wind, tall and golden, Will
            remained small, scrawny, green, and pliable - a late bloomer in every sense of the word. As the months passed, he
            watched the others flourish, stretching toward the sun, their grains ripening with pride, their upright
            stalks stiffening as they matured; growing long and thick.</p>

        <p>"Oh, come on!" Will would grumble to himself. “What’s taking me so long? This is so embarrassing!”. It was
            already mid-summer, and while Will was still as short and green as overgrown grass, he would look upon the
            proud wheat stalks with a deep envy.</p>

        <p>The other stalks barely noticed him. When they did, they'd rustle their golden heads in judgement. "Oh, poor
            Will," one would whisper. "Still green, huh?" another would chuckle, their grains shimmering in the breeze.
        </p>

        <p>Will tried to ignore them, but he couldn't shake the sinking feeling that he was a failure. Days blended into
            weeks, and the field began to buzz with anticipation as harvesting season drew near.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">One fateful afternoon, as Will’s soft green stem drooped under the weight of his underdeveloped grains, a
            girl wandered into the field. Her nose wrinkled as she stepped carefully between the rows, her arms folded
            across her chest as if shielding herself from an invisible threat. The girl crouched down next to Will,
            eyeing him with curiosity.</p>

        <p>"You don’t look like the others," the girl said.</p>

        <p>"Thanks for noticing," Will replied dryly, expecting some sort of mockery. But the girl smiled.</p>

        <p>"It’s a good thing," the girl said. "I’m allergic to the others. Can’t eat wheat at all, actually. It makes
            me sick."</p>

        <p>Will perked up. "Really? I mean, that’s... unfortunate for you. But I guess it makes me feel less bad about
            being, you know, a little different."</p>

        <p>The girl laughed softly. "Different’s not so bad, sometimes."</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">They talked for a while, Will telling the girl how lonely it felt being the last to mature, and the girl
            sharing her woes about not being able to eat things like bread and pasta. For the first time in his short,
            awkward life, Will felt understood. The girl didn’t pity him or mock him for his stunted growth; she seemed
            to genuinely appreciate him.</p>

        <p>As the sun began to set, the girl got up to leave. "Take care, little one," she said, patting Will’s head
            gently as she turned to leave. 🍃</p>

        <p>“WAIT!” screamed Will. “When will I see you again?”</p>

        <p>"Oh, I don’t know.” replied the girl. ‘Why do you ask?”</p>

        <p>“Because…” Will stammered. “Well, because, I…um, I kind of… I mean I know we just met, but I–”</p>

        <p>“Ohh nooo, this ain’t the Bee Movie lil bro” she cut him off while backing away with her head shaking.</p>

        <p>“Wait!” cried Will. “What’s that?”</p>

        <p>But she had already taken off. Will was devastated. If Will had a heart, it’d be in a million pieces.</p>

        <p>Then the harvesting season came.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The farmer's scythe swept through the field, collecting the tall, golden stalks in a flurry of
            motion. The wheat was bundled and carted away, their grains destined for bread, flour, and pastries. Will
            braced himself, expecting the sharp blade to finally come for him - but it never did.</p>

        <p>The farmer’s eyes skimmed over Will, deeming him unfit for harvest. Too small, too weak, too green. "Not
            worth the trouble," the farmer muttered as he passed by.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Will stood alone in the vast, empty field, the only stalk left as the others were hauled off to fulfill their
            purpose. A heavy silence settled over him. Winter soon arrived, and the once-golden field became a desolate,
            frozen wasteland. Snow piled high, and Will hunkered down, his body brittle and his spirit barely holding
            on.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The cold was relentless, but somehow, Will survived. He spent the long, dark winter reflecting on his strange
            little life, the brief moment of joy he’d found in meeting the girl, and the absurdity of it all. Why had
            the girl come to talk to him in the first place? What purpose did he serve now? And what was the “Bee
            Movie”?</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">As spring thawed the earth, Will found himself still standing, barely, but alive. His once-green stalk was
            now frail and graying, his grains thin and meager. He no longer expected much from life, but he couldn’t
            help holding onto a glimmer of hope. And then, just as the days grew warm again, he started to grow! And
            grow he did - practically doubling in size, the tonnage of his golden grain barely propped up by his girthy
            stalk.</p>

        <p>Then, one bright sunny day, the girl returned. Her face lit up with surprise when she saw Will still
            standing.</p>

        <p>"You’re alive!" the girl exclaimed, kneeling beside Will.</p>

        <p>"Yep, still here." Will murmured meekly.</p>

        <p>The girl sat down, gently caressing Will’s stalk. "You’ve made it through so much."</p>

        <p>"I guess I did," Will mused. "Though I’m not sure why. What’s left for a leftover stalk like me?"</p>

        <p>The girl smiled. "Maybe you’re here to start something new."</p>

        <p>“You know what?” exclaimed Will, finding his voice. “You might be right - I think…I think I might do it. I
            don’t know what, or how, but I think my reason for being here is to start something. Something new!”</p>

        <p>“Come on, you have to!” encouraged the girl.</p>

        <p><br>Will took a moment to gather his thoughts. <br>Then, after a long pause, he broke the silence.<br><br></p>

        <p>“I will!” announced Will.</p>

        <p>“Yep, I remember you Will.” said the girl. ”You’re the talking wheat stalk that caught feelings for
            me."</p>

        <p>“No - I mean, yes I am him, but no, I meant to say ‘I will’ as in ‘I am <i>going</i> to’... And no, you never tol-” Will awkwardly stumbled over his words before being inturrpted.</p>

        <p>“I’m sorry, I’m not following. You’re <i>going…where</i>? You’re a stalk of wheat - I don’t know if you’ve noticed
            yet, but you don’t have any feet.” exclaimed the girl sarcastically.</p>

        <p>“You know what? Nevermind.” Will resigned.</p>

        <p>“Oh, I’m just messing with you Will! I know exactly what you mean - and I love you! You’re so cute when you
            get all flustered.”</p>

        <p>“Really? You actually love me?” asked Will softly.</p>

        <p>“Of course!” exclaimed the girl.</p>

        <p>“That’s just because I’ve grown up now. What if I were still green and scrawny? You wouldn’t still think
            that.”</p>

        <p>“Oh Will, don’t be so silly! I never cared about how you looked, or how big you were. Don’t you remember? I’m
            allergic to wheat! I fell in love with your sweet personality, your humble demeanour, and your persevering attitude. Like, you’re true to who you are; you aren’t afraid of going against the grain.”</p>

        <p>“Oh!” shouted Will, his face beaming. “You know what they say...No pain, no grain, haha.”</p>

        <p>“I know you're just a stalk of wheat, but you’re like a brother to me!” reassured the girl.</p>

        <p>“Oh.” Will groaned.</p>

        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">There was a long silence, and for a moment, the two just stared deeply into eachothers eyes. At least that’s
            what it felt like for Will. I’m sure the girl saw things differently given that Will didn’t have eyes to
            stare into.</p>

        <p>“Ermmm, when you said I was here to start something new, what were you thinking?” Will asked, trying to change
            the subject.</p>

        <p>“Ever thought about having children?” asked the girl.</p>

        <p>“What a strange question. I guess I’d never thought about it.” answered Will. “I never got to meet my
            parents. None of us did.”</p>

        <p>“Oh you poor thing!” sighed the girl. “I’ll tell you what? What if I take your seeds and plant them in the
            field? Then you can have children of your own!”</p>

        <p>“I like that idea,” said Will matter-of-factly.</p>

        <p>With care, the girl delicately plucked the seeds from Will’s stalk.</p>

        <p>“Ooh…ow ow…wait! Urggh, go...slow-ly” struggled Will, sucking air through his non-existing teeth.</p>

        <p>“Don’t be such a baby!” teased the girl in a mocking tone.</p>

        <p>The girl collected Will’s fragile seeds cupping them in her hands. Then, with a soft motion, she scattered
            them across the field, letting the wind carry them. The seeds drifted, catching in the breeze and settling
            into the soil.</p>

        <p>Will felt a strange peace wash over him as he watched his seeds take root in the earth. His life had been
            small, brief, and full of struggle, but somehow, it had all led to this moment.</p>

        <p>"Well," Will said with a quiet chuckle, "I guess I can finally turn over a new leaf."</p>
